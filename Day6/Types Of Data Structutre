Need Of Data structure :

The structure of the data and the synthesis of the algorithm are relative to each other. Data presentation must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make an efficient implementation of the operation.
Data structures provide an easy way of organizing, retrieving, managing, and storing data.
Here is a list of the needs for data.

   * Data structure modification is easy.
   * It requires less time.
   * Save storage memory space.
   * Data representation is easy.
   * Easy access to the large database.

Types of Data Structures:
        There are two types of data Structure.They are:
        1) Linear Data Structure
        2) Non-Linear Structure

Linear Data Structure:
* In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent.
* In linear data structure, single level is involved
* Its implementation is easy in comparison to non-linear data structure.
* Applications of linear data structures are mainly in application software development.

Non-linear Data Structure:
* In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.
* Whereas in non-linear data structure, multiple levels are involved.
* While its implementation is complex in comparison to linear data structure.
* Applications of non-linear data structures are in Artificial Intelligence and image processing.

1.	In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent.	In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.
2.	In linear data structure, single level is involved.	                                                                                                    Whereas in non-linear data structure, multiple levels are involved.
3.	Its implementation is easy in comparison to non-linear data structure.	                                                                                While its implementation is complex in comparison to linear data structure.
4.	In linear data structure, data elements can be traversed in a single run only.	                                                                        While in non-linear data structure, data elements canâ€™t be traversed in a single run only.
5.	In a linear data structure, memory is not utilized in an efficient way.	                                                                                While in a non-linear data structure, memory is utilized in an efficient way.

6.	Its examples are: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.	                                                                                            While its examples are: trees and graphs.
7.	Applications of linear data structures are mainly in application software development.	                                                                Applications of non-linear data structures are in Artificial Intelligence and image processing.
8.	Linear data structures are useful for simple data storage and manipulation.	                                                                            Non-linear data structures are useful for representing complex relationships and data hierarchies, such as in social networks, file systems, or computer networks.
