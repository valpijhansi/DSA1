                                        Database vs DataStructure

            Database	                                                                                     Data Structure
      It is an organized collection of data.	                                                It is a special format for storing data to serve a particular purpose.
      It is used to access the data and manage it easily.	                                    It is used for efficiency and to reduce the complexities of the program.
      Structured query language (SQL) is used to perform operations on the data in a database.  Programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python are used to perform operations using data Structures.
      DataBase Management System (DBMS) is used to manage the database.

      It is a Non-volatile memory.	                                                             It is a volatile memory.
     Relational database, NOSQL database, Centralized database,                                  Linear data structure and non-linear data structure are the types of data structures.
     Hierarchical database are some types of databases.
     Example : MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Sybase etc.	                                             Example : Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph.
     Store Data in permanent Memory	                                                             Store Data in Temporary Memory
