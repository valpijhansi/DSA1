Ways to Approach a problem:
1.Reading the problem.
2.Analyzing/Understanding the problem.
3.Think of solution.
4.Pen down the Solution.
5.Write the code.

Ways to pen down the solution:
There are 3 ways to pen down the solution. They are:
1.Flowchart
2.Algorithm
3.psudeo code

What is an Algorithm ?
An algorithm is a step by step process of a problem.


What is Trade-Off in Programing Language ?
* A trade-off is a situation where one thing increases and another thing decreases
* It is a way to solve a problem in:
  1.Either in less time and by using more space,or
  2.In very little space by spending a long amount of time

* Types of space-Time Trade-off
 1.Compressed or Uncompressed data
 2.Re-Rendering or Stored images
 3.Smaller code or loop unrolling
 4.Lookup tables or Recalculation
