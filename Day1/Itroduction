Importance of Java :
1.Java is one of the most programming languages used to create web applications and platforms.
2.It was designed for flexibility,allowing developers to write code that would run on any machine regardless of architecture or platform.
3.Both Platform Independent and Multithreading these two features makes java is one of the popular programming language.


Java use both compiler and interpreter:
1.Java programming language uses both the compiler and interpreter.
2.Because the source programming code is first transformed into binary programming code.
3.That binary code is run by the JVM,which usually a software-based interpreter.

Java Compiler:
1.It scans the entire source code before highlighting error.
2.More memory is consumed during the bytecode creation process.
3.It checks to see if there are any typographical or syntactical errors to ensure that the program is correct.


Java Interpreter:
1.Java is compatible with every operating system and the java interpreter converts bytecode into machine code.
2.It translates language one line by one line.
