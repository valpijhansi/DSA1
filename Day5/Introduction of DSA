What is DSA?
* DSA is defined as a combination of two seperate yet interrelated topics Data Structure and Algorithms.


What is Data Structure?
* A data Structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the   data efficiently and effectively.
* The Main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities.
* an efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

Advantages of Data Structure:
* It is a good solution for storing data on framework
* It make it easier for us to handle data
* Data structure are critical for planning computations

What is Collection frameworks?
* The Collection framework contains an interface named an iterable interface which provides the iterator to iterate through all the collection.
* This interface is extended by the main collection interface which acts as a root for the collection framework

Use of Collection framework:
* It enables user to perform various data manipulation operations like storing data,searching,sorting,insertion,deletion and updating of data on the group of elements.

Advantages of collection framework:
* It reduces Programming effort
* Increases program speed and quality
* Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs
* Fosters software reuse
