Abstract Data Type:
* It is a type or class for objects whose behavior defined by a set of values and a set of operations.
* The ADT only mentions what operations will be implemented.
* it does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations
* It gives an implementation independent view
* The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction

Types of ADT:

1.List ADT
2.Stack ADT
3.Queue ADT

Features of ADT
--> Abstract data types are a way of encapsulating data and operations on that data into a single unit.
--> Some key features of ADT

    2.Better Conceptualization
    3.Robust
    4.Encapsulation
    5.Data Abstraction
    6.Data structure independence
    7.Information hiding
    8.Modularity
