Static Array:
     An array that is declared with the static keyword is known as static array.
     It allocates memory at compile-time whose size is fixed. We cannot alter the static array.


The syntax to declare a static array is:

 <data type> <variable name> []={<data1>,<data2>,.....<dataN>};

Advantages of Static Array

   * It has efficient execution time.
   * The lifetime of static allocation is the entire run time of the program.

Disadvantages of Static Array

   * In case more static data space is declared than needed, there is waste of space.
   * In case less static space is declared than needed, then it becomes impossible to expand this fixed size during run time.
